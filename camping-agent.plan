Task states: TODO, DONE, HOLD, 
Note types: IDEA, NOTE, IMPROVEMENT

PLAN 
- [ ] **PLAN** split the agent into different parts 
- [ ] **PLAN** brainstorm use cases


TODO
- [ ] **TODO** determine the neccessary parts
- [ ] **TODO** look up availability

Useful lists / info / data to have on hand:
List of NPS campsites, open/close dates
List of USFS campsites

## NPS API
> (Pdb) camp.keys()
dict_keys(['id', 'url', 'name', 'parkCode', 'description', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'latLong', 'audioDescription', 'isPassportStampLocation', 'passportStampLocationDescription', 'passportStampImages', 'geometryPoiId', 'reservationInfo', 'reservationUrl', 'regulationsurl', 'regulationsOverview', 'amenities', 'contacts', 'fees', 'directionsOverview', 'directionsUrl', 'operatingHours', 'addresses', 'images', 'weatherOverview', 'numberOfSitesReservable', 'numberOfSitesFirstComeFirstServe', 'campsites', 'accessibility', 'multimedia', 'relevanceScore', 'lastIndexedDate'])



**Loose and hard constraints**
- dates
- length of stay
- 

**Questions**
- How often do the data sources need to be updated
- How do I sanitize and parse info from web searches
- What APIs do I need access to and what info will I need to get at the last minute (road closures, etc)

**Parts of the Agent**
- collect information
  - loose and hard constraints, optional GUI for input
- suggest places to go
- Mitigating factors - reasons why this trip might be bad right now (mosquitos, road closures, fires, etc)

** Info sources **

> UI to return some options that you can click on and get more information for

**Use Cases
**- Suggest trips 
- Tell you the optimal booking window
- Summarizing reviews and info about the best time of year to go 
- Short term / next weekend suggest sites that don't need 

**Features
**- suggest campsites
- refine query based on UI with sliders, filters
- last step does a visit to the site to make sure its open


**Capabilities Questions
**Can we zero shot feed in raw html to an llm and have it determine if a campsite is open or closed, reliably 


Some way to narrow in area: 
draw on map, enter list of state codes, within X hours of Y driving,
